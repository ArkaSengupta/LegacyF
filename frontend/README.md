# React Frontend

This directory contains the React UI for the **LegacyF** project. It is built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for a fast and modern development experience.

## Development server

Install dependencies and start the dev server:

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```

## Building for production

Create an optimized production build with:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
